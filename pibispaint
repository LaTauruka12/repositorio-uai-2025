Got it! We've locked in "Clown-Bonded Lusamine & Lillie" with your new flow—freeform and spontaneous. Their transformation is chaotic, colorful, and co-dependent, laced with that twisted bonding energy only a cursed carnival mirror could create. They’re not just jesters—they're a duo of giggling chaos, sharing one leash, one master, and now one delightfully warped perspective.

Want help writing their first scene post-transformation? Or do you want to test what they sound like in character?
